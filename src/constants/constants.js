  quote: `“My work is aimed at bringing to your mind the strong feeling of your tender vision. This kind of art expresses aesthetics in Solid forms with surrealism and paranomasia as the principal theme. I’m interested in facilitating an interface between Subject and viewer, enabling you to navigate through my mind with your eyes, influenced by the unrelenting divergence of words and kaleidoscopic world around us. My work brings me peace and offers me a place to meditate and appreciate the Ultimate creator(God) and the beauty of the world”

  text: `For a couple of years, the artist Ayodeji Kingsley, has worked on although a pre-existing concept of art but a different lens of expression. He has thought through and taught truly the magnificent use of what others see as waste, brought them together in the praxis of fine aesthetics to express familiar ideas and entities such as: animals, tools, items and lots more.
    Though, Metal objects are rigid. They could still be bent to the will of an artist. They would do so in the right hands and with the right motives. Metals are lovely and they represent life in a really spectacular way, if only they are used fantastically. The evolution of man and the advancement of science and technology has shown a great deal how useful metals are and this had not left out art in all of its forms and systems.
    Kingsley has shown so much interest in turning scrap into incredible ideas plausible and almost indispensable in our world today. He has chosen a path that transforms static rubbish into static properties of adornments. The ornamental products of his art have helped lots of people to transfer their fantasies and illusions into substantial possessions. 
    I am a Co-creator in the direct image of the unequalled Ultimate Creator. - Ayodeji Kingsley `,
